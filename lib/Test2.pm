=head1 NAME

Test2 - Framework for writing test tools that all work together.

=head1 EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE

This is an experimental release. Using this right now is not recommended.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package exports all the functions necessary to write and/or verify testing
tools. Using these building blocks you can begin writing test tools very
quickly. You are also provided with tools that help you to test the tools you
write.

=head1 SYNOPSYS

=head2 WRITING A TOOL

The C<context()> method is your primary interface into the Test2 framework.

    package My::Ok;
    use Test2 qw/context/;

    our @EXPORT = qw/my_ok/;
    use base 'Exporter';

    # Just like ok() from Test::More
    sub my_ok($;$) {
        my ($bool, $name) = @_;
        my $ctx = context(); # Get a context
        $ctx->ok($bool, $name);
        $ctx->release; # Release the context
        return $bool;
    }

See L<Test2::Context> for a list of methods avabilable on the context object.

=head2 TESTING YOUR TOOLS

The C<intercept { ... }> tool lets you temporarily intercept all events
generated by the test system:

    use Test2 qw/intercept/;

    use My::Ok qw/my_ok/;

    my $events = intercept {
        # These events are not displayed
        my_ok(1, "pass");
        my_ok(0, "fail");
    };

    my_ok(@$events == 2, "got 2 events, the pass and the fail");
    my_ok($events->[0]->pass, "first event passed");
    my_ok(!$events->[1]->pass, "second event failed");

=head1 EXPORTS

All exports are optional, you must specify subs to import.

    use Test2 qw/context intercept run_subtest/;

=head2 context(...)

Usage:

=over 4

=item $ctx = context()

=item $ctx = context(%params)

=back

The C<context()> function will always return the current context to you. If
there is already a context active it will be returned. If there is not an
active context one will be generated. When a context is generated it will
default to using the file and line number where the currently running sub was
called from.

Please see L<Test2::Context/"CRITICAL DETAILS"> for important rules about what
you can and acannot do with a context once it is obtained.

B<Note> This function will throw an exception if you ignore the context object
it returns.

=head3 OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

All parameters to C<context> are optional.

=over 4

=item level => $int

If you must obtain a context in a sub deper than your entry point you can use
this to tell it how many EXTRA stack frames to look back. If this option is not
provided the default of C<0> is used.

    sub third_party_tool {
        my $sub = shift;
        ... # Does not obtain a context
        $sub->();
        ...
    }

    third_party_tool(sub {
        my $ctx = context(level => 1);
        ...
        $ctx->release;
    });

=item wrapped => $int

Use this if you need to write your own tool that wraps a call to C<context()>
with the intent that it should return a context object.

    sub my_context {
        my %params = ( wrapped => 0, @_ );
        $params{wrapped}++;
        my $ctx = context(%params);
        ...
        return $ctx;
    }

    sub my_tool {
        my $ctx = my_context();
        ...
        $ctx->release;
    }

If you do not do this than tools you call that also check for a context will
notice that the context they grabbed was created at the same stack depth, which
will trigger protective measures that warn you and destroy the existing
context.

=item stack => $stack

Normally C<context()> looks at the global hub stack initialized in
L<Test2::Global>. If you are maintaining your own L<Test2::Context::Stack>
instance you may pass it in to be used instead of the global one.

=item hub => $hub

Use this parameter if you want to onbtain the context for a specific hub
instead of whatever one happens to be at the top of the stack.

=item on_init => sub { ... }

This lets you provide a callback sub that will be called B<ONLY> if your call
to c<context()> generated a new context. The callback B<WILL NOT> be called if
C<context()> is returning an existing context. The only argument passed into
the callback will be the context object itself.

    sub foo {
        my $ctx = context(on_init => sub { 'will run' });

        my $inner = sub {
            # This callback is not run since we are getting the existing
            # context from our parent sub.
            my $ctx = context(on_init => sub { 'will NOT run' });
            $ctx->release;
        }
        $inner->();

        $ctx->release;
    }

=item on_release => sub { ... }

This lets you provide a callback sub that will be called when the context
instance is released. This callback will be added to the returned context even
if an existing context is returned. If multiple calls to context add callbacks
then all will be called in reverse order when the context is finally released.

    sub foo {
        my $ctx = context(on_release => sub { 'will run second' });

        my $inner = sub {
            my $ctx = context(on_release => sub { 'will run first' });

            # Neither callback runs on this release
            $ctx->release;
        }
        $inner->();

        # Both callbacks run here.
        $ctx->release;
    }

=back

=head2 intercept(&)

Usage:

    my $events = intercept {
        ok(1, "pass");
        ok(0, "fail");
        ...
    };

This function takes a codeblock as its only argument, and it has a prototype.
It will execute the codeblock, intercepting any generated events in the
process. It will return an array reference with all the generated event
objects. All events should be subclasses of L<Test2::Event>.

This is a very low-level subtest tool. This is useful for writing tools which
procude subtests. This is not intended for people simply writing tests.

=head2 run_subtest(...)

Usage:

    run_subtest($NAME, \&CODE, $BUFFERED, @ARGS)

This will run the provided codeblock with the args in C<@args>. This codeblock
will be run as a subtest. A subtest is an isolated test state that is condensed
into a single L<Test2::Event::Subtest> event, which contains all events
generated inside the subtest.

Arguments:

=over 4

=item $NAME

The name of the subtest.

=item \&CODE

The code to run inside the subtest.

=item $BUFFERED

If this is true then the subtest will be buffered. In a buffered subtest the
child events are hidden from the formatter, the formatter will only recieve the
final L<Test2:Event::Subtest> event. In an unbuffered subtest the formatter
will see all events as they happen, as well as the final one.

=item @ARGS

Any extra arguments you want passed into the subtest code.
